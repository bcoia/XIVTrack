The free races of Eorzea have reared the rotund creatures ever since, though they are now valued primarily for their meat. Would-be poultry farmers be warned: when seeking to defend itself, a dodo will spit forth a sleep-inducing secretion."

Tonberries wear clothing and are adept in the use of complex tools, both of which would seem to suggest a civilized level of intelligence.

Conditioned by the brutal nature of their surroundings, cactuars are quick to defend themselves, launching a barrage of needle-like projectiles at potential predators-and the occasional unwary traveler."
